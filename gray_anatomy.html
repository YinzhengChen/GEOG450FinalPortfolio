    <h1>A Week of Green in the Rainy City: Reading UW's Quad Through Color</h1>
    
    <p>Seattle is famous for drizzle, yet the city's palette is far richer. One of the clearest proofs sits at the heart of campus: the University of Washington Quad, where Yoshino cherry trees bloom pink each spring before giving way to a vivid summer canopy. I photographed the Quad every afternoon from May&nbsp;13&nbsp;to&nbsp;May&nbsp;17 and distilled each image to its ten most common colors to test a hunch&mdash;after blossom season, green would dominate even Seattle's rain‑washed afternoons.</p>

    <p>Figure 1 stacks those dominant hues by percentage of pixels for six half hour slots each day. I chose a stacked bar chart because it lets the reader compare the relative weight of colors across time while still seeing the complete 100 % of every photograph. The x axis is time stamped to emphasize the rhythm of daily observations, and the y axis is normalized so even a fleeting burst of blue sky registers. Color itself is the key visual variable; no legend is needed because the bars literally are the colors. The pattern is unmistakable: deep olives and mossy greens routinely claim nearly half of every frame, validating my prediction. Cool grays hover around a quarter of the total, nodding to the city's 150 plus rainy days a year. Weather Channel. (2016, October 15). Only on May 16 did pale blues spike above ten percent, coinciding with a rare break in the clouds. These bands do more than quantify foliage; they echo Seattle's “Emerald City” moniker and extend the seasonal narrative begun by the cherry blossoms that draw thousands each March. University of Washington. (2022).<p>
    <p>Every afternoon of that week I stood at the Quad's midpoint and took a single phone photo from the same eye level vantage, ensuring each frame captured the identical sweep of lawn, paths, and Elms. Back in Google Colab, I pointed a for img in file_list: loop at the folder of JPEGs: for every filename the loop opened the picture, posterized it to ten adaptive colors with Pillow, converted those palette indices back to RGB, and handed the array to NumPy. Pixel counts flowed into a pandas DataFrame row by row until all images had been translated into tidy numbers, after which Altair stacked the percentages into the vertical bars you now see. In effect, the loop turned a week of snapshots into a reproducible color diary that can refresh itself with a single click whenever new photos arrive.<p>
    <p>I'm pleased that the chart captures the Quad's living color cycle in a way numbers alone cannot. One surprise was how temperamental palette conversion proved; early attempts produced mismatched arrays and length errors until I simplified the routine to posterize count append in a single pass. Next time I will extend the timeline through autumn so readers can watch greens surrender to golds, completing the chromatic portrait of UW's signature space.<p>
