    <h1>Tracing Migration Flows to Seattle: Understanding a Growing City</h1>
    
    <p>Seattle, often associated with its rainy weather and iconic skyline, has evolved into one of the fastest-growing metro areas in the U.S., particularly due to its rising immigrant and domestic migration population. Between 2000 and 2020, the city's immigrant population grew by 47%, accounting for nearly 30% of the total population (City of Seattle Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs). To better understand this dynamic transformation, our group created a Sankey diagram to visualize the volume of migration to the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metro area, revealing where people are moving from and highlighting both national and international migration patterns.<p>
    <p>Our infographic illustrates the volume of people who moved to the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metro area from various U.S. metro areas as well as from broader international regions, including Asia and Europe, during the years 2016 to 2020. Notably, the largest flows came from “Non-Metro Within U.S.” (17,039), followed by Asia (23,133), Los Angeles (8,813), and Portland (8,005). By highlighting both domestic and international migration, the infographic emphasizes the city's role as a national and global destination. The use of a Sankey diagram with distinct node colors and proportional link widths visually captures the magnitude of these migration streams and spatial connections to Seattle. Yellow-highlighted flows draw attention to the more substantial international movements, contrasting with the gray domestic flows for readability.<p>

   <p>The data for this project came from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2016'2020 metro-to-metro migration tables. To prepare the dataset, we filtered only the inbound flows to Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue and aggregated the total number of migrants from each region. We chose a Sankey diagram because it clearly communicates direction, quantity, and origin in one glance. Compared to a bar chart or map, a Sankey diagram helps the viewer understand both the diversity and scale of Seattle's inbound migration in a single visual. The visual variables we applied included line thickness for flow volume, and contrasting colors to distinguish metro regions (gray) from international regions (yellow and green), while Seattle itself is represented by the black endpoint node.<p>
   <p>This visualization connects closely to Seattle's broader characteristics as a city shaped by mobility, economic opportunity, and international influence. As one article from Axios put it, "Seattle metro grows faster than U.S., driven by foreign immigration" (2025). While we cannot directly confirm the causal factors behind these migration patterns through this dataset alone, our visualization supports the broader narrative that Seattle continues to attract newcomers from both coasts and around the world. Especially telling is the large migration from Asia—outpacing even the largest single domestic source regions. This underlines Seattle's growing role as a Pacific gateway city with increasingly global ties.<p>
   <p>Throughout this project, I contributed by analyzing and helping build the Sankey diagram using Python and a cleaned CSV version of the Census data. At first, I found it difficult to determine which data columns to isolate, but collaborating with my group helped clarify the dataset structure. Seeing how we transformed raw data into a compelling story helped me appreciate the role of data visualization in geographic storytelling.<p>
   <p>One strength of our project was the coordination and flexibility in dividing tasks. We split the project by different visualization directions and combined insights to decide which one conveyed the clearest message. The Sankey diagram stood out because it immediately demonstrated where most people came from and gave structure to our narrative. If I were to improve the project further, I would explore adding time-based animations or disaggregating flows by year to better show temporal changes.<p>
   <p>This assignment also made me think more deeply about how Seattle is not just a physical location but also a node in a much larger network of migration, shaped by housing, job opportunities, and global movement. Next time, I hope to push the technical side further by incorporating interactive elements into the infographic to enhance user engagement.<p>
