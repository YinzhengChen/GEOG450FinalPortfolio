    <h1>Spokes of Flavor: A Radial Infographic Guide to Ten Must-Try Restaurants in Seattle's International District</h1>
    
    <p>I began this project by flipping through Seattleness and pausing at the radial map of the 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition (Fig.1).¹ Its center outward logic—map in the middle, data radiating like spokes—felt perfect for a compact tour of the International District (ID). I asked classmates how they planned to use Yelp data; most wanted sentiment analysis of user comments. That route sounded interesting, yet the Fusion API no longer returns full comment text, and scraping reviews would violate the site's terms. Instead of chasing a permission I did not have, I pivoted: turn each restaurant's meta data into quick read leaves—rating, review count, phone, and address. The map stays central; the branches still tell a story, but the leaves now answer the ID visitor's first practical questions: Is it good? How popular? How do I call? Where exactly is it?</p>

    <p>I queried the Yelp Fusion API for all restaurants whose street addresses fall inside the International District polygon. After deduping the 84 place return, I built a shortlist two ways: (1) personal taste—six venues I have eaten at and regard as the ID's stand out flavors; (2) public consensus—those scoring ≥ 4.0 stars with at least 100 reviews. From that blend of firsthand experience and crowd data I selected the ten most balanced across Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and pan Asian cuisines. Each record was reshaped into a hierarchy—root “review,” a branch for the restaurant name, and four child nodes holding rating, review count, phone, and address—then passed to D3's cluster layout</p>
    
    <p><strong>Chart Design Choices:</strong> Placing a simplified street map of the ID at the hub preserves geography while freeing space for data. Circles encode popularity, leaves encode logistics, and colored links hint at cuisine diversity without labeling it explicitly&mdash;viewers discover variety by following different hues. This design echoes the AYP inspiration but swaps amusements for meals, upgrading a historic exposition map into a 2025 food guide:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.</p>

    <p>The biggest win was solving the “comment access” roadblock by reframing what “helpful information” means. Ratings and reviews already distill collective sentiment; adding phone and address turns the graphic into a self contained decision tool that respects API limits. The main weakness was teamwork. My group relied almost entirely on asynchronous chats; feedback loops slowed and we squeezed the final SVG export into the last night. Next time I will propose at least one live coworking session per milestone and assign explicit roles (data wrangler, designer, writer) so we can iterate sooner and manage time better.</p>
